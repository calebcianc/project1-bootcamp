## Installation:

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. In the project directory, you can run the following to install the dependencies required for the project

- npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
- npm install -D tailwindcss
- npx tailwindcss init
  (Refer to [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for full guide)

## Usage

First, add a task by pressing the '+ New Task' button at the bottom of the page.
Enter details of the task such as 'Name', 'Description', 'Category' and 'Priority' and click 'Add'.
The task will appear in the task table, with a checkbox to check it as done - this then decorates the task with a strikethrough.
If you wish to hide the completed task, click on the 'Hide" button. Click the 'Show' button to show the completed task.

The app also has a pomodoro timer which has 3 buttons: 'Start', 'Skip', and 'Restart'. 'Start' begins the countdown of the timer; 'Pause' pauses the countdown; 'Skip' brings the countdown to zero and starts the next timer which is a short break and has a 5mins countdown; 'Restart' brings the countdown back up.
